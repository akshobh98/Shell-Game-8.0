Sprint4:
-cups would move the moment scene started and ignore the "begin" button (resolved)
-cups would spawn twice, two sets, and only one set would move are button activation (resolved)
-cups would infinitely move between their spots once the button was clicked once (resolved)
-cups would sometimes move backwards and leave the scene (resolved)
-cups would stop before reaching end position due to varying frame rate and the move being tied to the frame rate. (resolved)
-cups on each move would slowly inch forward or backwards, depending on number of cups, until they went off screen if user kept activating the move. (resolved)

-cups won't always start in the right position and when button is activated they shift into the correct positions and wait for a second button press (unresolved)
