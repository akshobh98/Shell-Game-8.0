This Shell game Unity project is still currently under development.

Individual components are being devloped in Unity and will be combined for a finished product.

Testing cannot be completed until more of the final product is fully functional.

Once each individual Unity component is operational a final Unity project will be released.

That final unity project will include installation instructions for a user. 

However this is currently being used to store data for our work in the mean time since each part is sectioned off.

At this current time this project CANNOT have automated testing because it doesn't fit yet. 

Once more finalized versions of the components have been developed a different testing will be used. 

Our testing approach will be different since our product requires user input, so a python script to simulate a person will be made at a later time.
